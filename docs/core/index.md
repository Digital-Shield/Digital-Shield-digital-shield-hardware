# DigitShield Core

DigitShield Core is the second-gen firmware running on DigitShield devices. It currently runs on DigitShield Touch only, but it will probably be used on DigitShield mini/classic in future as well.

DigitShield Core is part of the DigitShield-firmware monorepo to be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ziancube/digitshield-touch-firmware), in the `core` subdirectory.
